#  A Gatsby template: gatsby-starter-i18n-bulma

## Introduction

If you want to try it, you can run this command:

```
gatsby new https://github.com/kalwalt/gatsby-starter-i18n-bulma
```

Then you need to run the yarn installer to install all the packages and dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

As yarn has finished to install all the packages then you can run:

```
gatsby develop
```

## Features

and much more...
